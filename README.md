# Beginner-Keylogger-Project
This project showcases the pynput API and its uses in the realm of cybersecurity in the form of a keystroke monitor

Given my general interest in cybersecurity, I felt this project was a good way to learn more and showcase what I have learned in a controlled environment. While this project may seem fairly rudimentary, it serves as a very nice stepping stone into developing more utilitarian-natured projects with applications in cybersecurity.

# Overview #
This function of this project is pretty much given away in the title. It's really only meant to record the key strokes/inputs of the user in a text file that will be created as the code runs. It also has a terminal output given by the ```print(str(key))``` line.

# Now a brief demo:
Let's say a I had this running in the background for some unknown reason. Perhaps it was to test it. Now, the pynput API will recognize inputs from the keyboard no matter where you are typing. It can be in google, it can be in a login website, or any other text field. For the purposes of this demo, I will assume the role of someone typing "How to cook instant ramen" into a google text field.
