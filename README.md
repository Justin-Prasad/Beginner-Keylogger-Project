# Beginner-Keylogger-Project
This project showcases the pynput API and its uses in the realm of cybersecurity in the form of a keystroke monitor


Given my general interest in cybersecurity, I felt this project was a good way to learn more and showcase what I have learned in a controlled environment. While this project may seem fairly rudimentary, it serves as a very nice stepping stone into developing more utilitarian-natured projects with applications in cybersecurity.
